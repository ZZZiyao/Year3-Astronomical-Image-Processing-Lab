This project processes optical CCD images (~10^7 pixels) in FITS format to detect galaxies within a specific extragalactic segment. The task involved developing algorithms that identify galaxies from high-noise backgrounds and measuring their apparent magnitude. We successfully identified 8,000 galaxies and fitted the result to a non-evolution model.

Extention works including calculate the two point correlation function of galaxies, which proved the uneven distribution of galaxies in the local universe.

We conducted a 10-min [presentation](https://github.com/ZZZiyao/Year-3-Lab-cycle-1-Astronomical-image-processing/blob/main/Lab1_astroimage.pptx) to two assessors.
